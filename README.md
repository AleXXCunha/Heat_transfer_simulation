# Heat_transfer_simulation
Simulation of heat conduction using finite differences in Python.

In the heat and mass transport discipline we were asked to do a computacional work that simulates a heat conduction through a testcase so that we could solve differential equations using finite differences in a practical way. Our main purpose was to find numerics resolution of the heat diffusion equation in different calculation domains and with different boundary conditions, which is almost impossible to be done manually but quite easy with the support of the computational labor.

The script of this work can be found in the file "Script.pdf", the code that solves the testcase number 3 (which was assigned to me by the professor) in the file "trab.py" and the report with all the results and analyses in the "Report.pdf". All the other files are obtained from the interpretation of the Python code and are explained and cited in the report.
