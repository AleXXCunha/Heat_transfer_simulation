# Heat_transfer_simulation
Project developed in Python for the discipline of Heat and Mass Transfer to solve differential equations using finite differences in a practical way. The project consists on the transient simulation of a 2D surface with specific initial temperature conditional parameters. Our main purpose was to find numerics resolutions of the heat diffusion equation in different calculation domains and with different boundary conditions, which is almost impossible to be done manually but quite easy with the support of the computational labor.

The script of this work can be found in the file "Script.pdf", the code that solves the testcase number 3 (which was assigned to me by the professor) in the file "trab.py" and the report with all the results and analyses in the "Report.pdf". All the other files are obtained from the interpretation of the Python code and are explained and cited in the report.

It was a great opportunity to remember and learn more about Python and the principles of heat diffusion.
